The Shoe - Overview 

In the event to increase security posture of Skechers AWS cloud environment, Cloud Sec team must ensure that all Server Instances are monitored and logged by the Lacework security tool. 

The laces - Current responsibilities/Events 

As a continuation of the Lacework agent installation to ensure all our servers are compliant, I had meeting with William to discuss Lacework installation on Windows server instances, We initially identified few Windows based instances that requires a little tweak in the installation script. 
Therefore, I provided guidance including the commands, MSI URL and AccessToken to use for the SKX-It-nonprod and SKX-it accounts where the windows instance are located.[1]

Also had a meeting with Mohan to discuss progress regarding the challenges encountered during the attempt to install lacework agent in the Databricks account instances. I followed up the issue until I confirmed that the issue was resolved by modifying the security Group rule to allow the communication traffic from the agent.

Implementation Roadmap - To enforce security posture based on Cloud security practices

1) SSM Agent and policy requirement for new EC2 instances (Prerequisite for the Lacework agent installation script to successfully complete)

Being that every instance in our environment is required to have Lacework agent installed and we have previously created an automation method using CloudWatch events rules to watches for RunInstances API and then trigger a lambda that uses SSM to run the lacework agent installation script "install.sh" on newly launched EC2 Instances. 

To avoid the bypass/failure of the automation, I suggest that we implementation of some guardrail policy in the Organization's Service Control Policy (SCP) to enforce the Prerequisites for the lacework agent installation to be successful.  

Two important requirements for the automation lambda to successfully install the lacework agent to all the newly launched Instances; 
- All AMIâ€™s used to launch the instance in the RunInstances API must have SSM agent pre-installed (this is default for Amazon linux 2 based AMIs). 
- All Instance profile roles attached to the instance during the RunInstances Api must have SSM permissions including "ssm:SendCommand". 

From my research, errors due to the latter can be mitigated by updating the existing automation lambda to first scan the instance profile role using the "simulate_principal_policy" API to simulate for the presence of the required "ssm:SendCommand" permission else, call "attach-role-policy" API to append the AmazonSSMFullAccess managed policy to the instance profile role. 

2) Apply a PermissionBoundry SCP at the Organization level to restrict all CreateRole API to include a PB policy 

This will ensure that even when a role is overly permissive, the permission boundary still restricts what the role can do in the environment. 

The goal of this SCP is to deny creation of role without the specified PB that will restrict them from certain powerful/forbidden APIs even though they are attached with AdministratorAccess. 


3) IAM findings alert Cleanup (Lacework/Ermetric reporting)

According to the generated alert report from our security monitoring tool, we have over 900+ findings related the IAM from different AWS account in our environment in different finding types like;
